7345961483593974533;Umm, didn’t you just flip the pillars? Still doing the same thing;7346054804642464517;7345961483593974533;Nope, they're totally different. If you analyze, the 1st example is categorized per your goals or content delivery. While the 2nd presentation is categorized by your "main topics." ☺️

Still doing the same thing;7346070147055469318;7345961483593974533;The educate, entertain, engage, etc. focuses on your "content" marketing goals and types. While the Tofu, Mofu, and Bofu focuses on your sales funnel or customer's journey for your products/ services.
